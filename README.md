<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About the Reusable React
[![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot]](https://reusable-react-seven.vercel.app/)

My place to store Reusable Component in React. And this repositoryh is a collection of pre-built, modular components that can be used across multiple projects. The purpose of such a repository is to allow developer to save time and effort by not having to build every component from scratch for each project.
The reusable React components can be built and stored in a centralized location, such as a private/public Github repository or an internal npm package. This repository can contain a range of components, from simple UI elements like buttons and form fields, to more complex components like ~~navigation menus~~ and ~~data visualizeation charts~~. 
By using a reusable component repository, developers can ensure consistency and maintainability across multiple projects. When a bug is fized or an improvement is made to a component, those changes can be easily propagated across all projects that use the component.
Additionally, a reusable component repositoryh can help enforce design guidelines and accessibility standards, as all components will be built with the same codebase and adhere to the same standards. Overall, a reusable React component repositoryh is a valuable tool for any organization that builds multiple React projects and wants to improve development efficiency, consistency and maintainability.

### Built With
This projects is built with
* [React](https://reactjs.org/) is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces
* [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) a javascript build tool


<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started
This is an example of how you may give instructions on setting up your project locally.
To get a local copy up and running follow these simple example steps.

### Installation
To run the application, after you install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) you also need [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) installed on your system. This project is also using [vite](https://vitejs.dev/) as a build tool that aims to provide a faster develpoment experience. Once you have those dependencies installed, you can install the application by running the following command in the root directory of the project:
```bash
$ cd your-project
$ yarn
$ yarn dev
``` 

### Usage
To use the application, you will need to have a GeoJSON file that you want to visualize. Once you have the file, you can start the application by running the following command:
```bash
$ yarn dev
```
This will start the application and open a web browser window with the application interface. From there, you can use the various controls to view and manipulate the data in the GeoJSON file.


<!-- ROADMAP -->
## Roadmap

See the [open issues](https://github.com/aindrajaya/reusable-react/issues) for a list of proposed features (and known issues).

<!-- ROADMAP -->
## Purpose
* Knowing how to use React in case create Reusable components
* Store the knowledge of creating Reusable components
* Build both components and hooks together
* Knowing how things work under the hood, and build things to solidify that understanding.


## Features
* Reusable components
* etc...
